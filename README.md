# OSL3

OSL 3 is the next iteration of the osl programming language. 

Currently [originOS](https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS) uses osl2, 
a high level text based programming language used to develop graphical 
interfaces for users to interact with.

OSL3 is a refinement of OSL2 with a whole lot more commands to use for program 
flow manipulation and new and easier syntax to understand and use, pulling 
inspiration from languages like c and python.
